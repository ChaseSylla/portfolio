        <h2>Comprehensive Computer Science</h2>
        <p>Personally, my dream job is to work daily with computer hardware to teach people how to use it better and be efficent. Where that happens doesn't matter too much to me.</p>
        <h3>Senior</h3>
        <p>I have taken Web Design classes already, so the main thing I hope to gain from this class is the theory around designing a website. I've done scripting in HTML and CSS as well so it's mainly for how to make a website look great.</p>
        <h4><u>My Favorite Things</u></h4>
        <p>Some of my favorite things are my dogs and cat, my car, all my friends and co workers that I am thankful for, and all of the fun things I do in my free time.</p>
